     "findings": "This is a <i>preview</i> for 3 independent studies on HA breathing in this issue. These studies revealed <i>occluded</i> epitopes on the HA head that are exposed when the HA is <i>breathing</i>, where the inter-protomer HA head domain contact surface can be recognized by Abs. Surprisingly, Abs targeting these area lacked neutralizing activity <i>in vitro</i>, but they do have protective efficacy in mouse model of infection. Notably, these Abs can recognize a large range of flu HA subtypes.",

In stark contrast to H3N2 and H1N1, it never added N-linked glycosylation to its head domain. <i>In vitro</i>, however, glycosylation was added to escape from mAbs recognition but it comes with a great fitness cost, namely reduction in receptor-binding and membrane-fusion activity.",

     "findings": "Here the authors discussed H28-A2 mAb (IgM), where notably it generated PR8 escape at an extremely low frequency of 1 in 1 billion (10<sup>â€“9.12</sup>), a frequency that corresponds to a simultaneous double mutant despite having a typical anti-HA affinity. The footprint of H28-A2 is unknown. A single K144N substitution is enough to escape H28-A2, but PR8 typically evolved with a compensatory mutation elsewhere on the HA (either P186S, D225G or N193K; all these substitutions confer high avidity binding to sialic acid). Surprisingly, H28-A2 escape mutants can't escape polyclonal Ab well. This suggests that H28-A2 escape mutants (with the aforementioned compensatory mutations) prioritized for receptor avidity than Ab escape.",
