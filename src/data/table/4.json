Importantly, persistent GCs continuously output HA<sup>+</sup> MBCs. However, it is unclear (to me) what were also being outputted by the persistent GCs other than HA<sup>+</sup> MBCs. Of note, the authors measured the 'peak' and 'late' GC output of ~1-5 anti-flu MBCs/day; suggesting that antiviral MBCs production isn't exclusive during the early GC response as often discussed.",

     "findings": "While it is known that lung B resident memory (B<sub>RM</sub>) can mediate protection upon rechallenge, the precise orchestration of B<sub>RM</sub> was relatively unknown. They generated 'BAT' mice (Blimp1<sup>mVenus</sup> AID<sup>Cre/+</sup> Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup>) to track activated B cells ('red') and plasma cells ('orange'). Upon rechallenge, lung PCs (tdTomato<sup>+</sup> mVenus<sup>+</sup>) moved around a lot (measurable within 24 hr), but lung B<sub>RM</sub> (tdTomato<sup>+</sup> mVenus<sup>–</sup>) did not move as much. Interestingly, this rapid migration is antigen-independent and may involve recognition of PAMPs (e.g., free-floating RNA). Furthermore, during homeostasis post-primary infection, PCs were found clustered near large airways. Shortly after rechallenge (~4 days), the 'alveolar' PCs were found sparsely distributed in lung parenchyma. While I expected them to be mostly IgA, they were mostly IgG-switched cells. Alevolar macrophages are crucial for the activation of alveolar B cells through cytokine/chemokine productions.",
